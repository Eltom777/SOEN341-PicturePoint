# SOEN341-PicturePoint

## Description
## Objective
The objective of Picture Point is to create an Instagram like web application. We wanted to take a new spin on the Instagram concept by focusing on group/event picture sharing rather than the individual user. We will keep the base model of individually posting pictures, however users will also be able to create groups with other users to post/share pictures with members of the gorup or publicly.
