# Picture Point (SOEN 341)

## Description
Picture Point is a photo-sharing web application. Similar to [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/424737657584573), users may upload and post pictures to their own profile, follow other users and like/comment on published pictures. This application enables people to create a network of friends virtually and share pictures with them via a feed that compiles all of their pictures together.
## Objective
The focus of the application is to provide a social media like platform for users to store their pictures safely and be able to share them with other users or friends. This application can be viewed as a mixture of a social media platform and a cloud for images. Each user controls his own uploaded pictures on his profile but these pictures can be liked and commented on by any other user. Firebase is hosted on Secure Sockets Layer which is a typical security technology used to establish encrypted links between a server & client. This concept comes handy to developers when securing the data manipulation into the NoSQL Firebase database.
